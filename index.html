      Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or
      the player decides to "hold": <br />
      If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next
      player's turn. <br />
      If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and
      the player's turn continues. <br />
      If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score,
      and it becomes the next player's turn. <br />
      The first player to score 100 or more points wins. <br />
      <br />
      <!-- Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again. Donald
      rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to
      roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The
      next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-6, after which she chooses
      to hold, and adds her turn total of 23 points to her score. -->
